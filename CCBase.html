<h4>1. Statement of Purpose</h4>
This site is meant to be open, inclusive, and enjoyable by all users. These rules are intended to accomplish that aim. They should be interpreted in the broadest possible light to accomplish that goal, and any ambiguity should be resolved with that in mind.
<h4>2. Ownership</h4>
Insofar as a forum can be ‘owned’, it is currently owned jointly by Xon, Lord Squishy, and Ford Prefect in equal proportion. The domain name currently being used, sufficientvelocity.com, is owned by Shockz who has very kindly let it be used for this purpose.
<h4>3. Management Decision-Making</h4>
The three owners have agreed that, management decisions shall, to the extent practical, be made by consensus. Policy questions shall be directed to either Lord Squishy or Ford Prefect. Where a policy decision is made by one owner, appeals of management decisions made by Lord Squishy or Ford Prefect shall be made to the other, and if the two disagree, then Xon shall break the tie.
<h4>4. Administrative Tribunal</h4>
<h4>5. Community Councillors</h4>
