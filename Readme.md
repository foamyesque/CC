<h4>1. Statement of Purpose</h4>
This site is meant to be open, inclusive, and enjoyable by all users. These rules are intended to accomplish that aim. They should be interpreted in the broadest possible light to accomplish that goal, and any ambiguity should be resolved with that in mind.
<h4>2. Ownership</h4>
Insofar as a forum can be ‘owned’, it is currently owned jointly by Xon, Lord Squishy, and Ford Prefect in equal proportion. The domain name currently being used, sufficientvelocity.com, is owned by Shockz who has very kindly let it be used for this purpose.
<h4>3. Management Decision-Making</h4>
The three owners have agreed that, management decisions shall, to the extent practical, be made by consensus. Policy questions shall be directed to either Lord Squishy or Ford Prefect. Where a policy decision is made by one owner, appeals of management decisions made by Lord Squishy or Ford Prefect shall be made to the other, and if the two disagree, then Xon shall break the tie.
<h4>4. Administrative Tribunal</h4>
The community's views on policy and discipline is to be represented by the Administrative Tribunal, which shall have the final power of reviewing infractions in a public and open forum.
<h4>5. Community Councillors</h4>

<p class="tab">(ii). The 24 users who recieve the most nominations in that time will stand for election. In case of a tie which results in more than 24 potential candidates, the ones nominated later will be dropped from the roster. </p>
<p class="tab">(iii). Polling will be done by multiple voting. Each user can vote for any, or all, of the candidates. Polling will last from August 16 to August 23rd.</p>
<p>(F). Councillors may be removed for misconduct by a majority vote of a specially-constituted panel of the Tribunal.</p>
<p>(G). Councillors who have been idle in the performance of their duties without due cause for more than 3 constituted Tribunal panels may be removed by a simple majority vote of the Directors.</p>
<p>(H). Councillors may resign at any time by a statement to that effect.</p>
<p>(I). If at any time more than one seat is open due to resignation or removal, a special election shall be held to fill those seats using the normal procedure. The members elected to fill those seats will be declared to have served a term if the special election is less than 6 months into the term, and not to have served a term if more.
<p>(J). A Councillor may not serve more than two sequential terms.</p>
