<h2><a name="Title1">Title I: Preamble and Structure</a></h2>
<h4>1. Statement of Purpose</h4>
This site is meant to be open, inclusive, and enjoyable by all users. These rules are intended to accomplish that aim. They should be interpreted in the broadest possible light to accomplish that goal, and any ambiguity should be resolved with that in mind.
<h4>2. Ownership</h4>
Insofar as a forum can be ‘owned’, it is currently owned jointly by Xon, Lord Squishy, and Ford Prefect in equal proportion. The domain name currently being used, sufficientvelocity.com, is owned by Shockz who has very kindly let it be used for this purpose.
<h4>3. Management Decision-Making</h4>
The three owners have agreed that, management decisions shall, to the extent practical, be made by consensus. Policy questions shall be directed to either Lord Squishy or Ford Prefect. Where a policy decision is made by one owner, appeals of management decisions made by Lord Squishy or Ford Prefect shall be made to the other, and if the two disagree, then Xon shall break the tie.
<h4>4. Administrative Tribunal</h4>
The community's views on policy and discipline is to be represented by the Administrative Tribunal, which shall have the final power of reviewing infractions in a public and open forum.
<h4>5. Community Councillors</h4>
Community Councillors are the elected members of the Administrative Tribunal whose job it is to represent the views and opinions of the community.
<p class="ind1">(1). There shall be twelve Community Councillors.</p>
<p class="ind1">(2). Community Councillors are elected for twelve month terms.</p>
<p class="ind1">(3). Elections shall take place during the month of August, with each term beginning September 1 and ending August 31.</p>
<p class="ind1">(4). All non-staff members who are not currently banned are eligible for nomination and election.
<p class="ind1">(5). Elections shall take place using the following procedure:
<p class="ind2">(a). Nominations will run for one week, from August 6 to August 13. Each user will be permitted to nominate two different users for election.</p>
<p class="ind2">(b). The 24 users who recieve the most nominations in that time will stand for election. In case of a tie which results in more than 24 potential candidates, the ones nominated later will be dropped from the roster. </p>
<p class="ind2">(c). Polling will be done by multiple voting. Each user can vote for any, or all, of the candidates. Polling will last from August 16 to August 23rd.</p>
<p class="ind1">(6). Councillors may be removed for misconduct by a majority vote of a specially-constituted panel of the Tribunal.</p>
<p class="ind1">(7). Councillors who have been idle in the performance of their duties without due cause for more than 3 constituted Tribunal panels may be removed by a simple majority vote of the Directors.</p>
<p class="ind1">(8). Councillors may resign at any time by a statement to that effect.</p>
<p class="ind1">(9). If at any time more than one seat is open due to resignation or removal, a special election shall be held to fill those seats using the normal procedure. The members elected to fill those seats will be declared to have served a term if the special election is less than 6 months into the term, and not to have served a term if more.
<p class="ind1">(10). A Councillor may not serve more than two sequential terms.</p>
<p class="ind1">(11). During the course of their duties, Community Councillors are bound by the same obligations as the Staff.</p>

<h2><a name="Title3">Title III: Appeals and Procedure</a></h2>
<h4>1. Interpretation</h4>
In order to secure the expeditious review of Staff decisions which might be unfair, arbitrary and capricious, malicious, or otherwise patently unreasonable, these Rules set out a specific review process for users to follow.
<h3> Chapter 1: Objection to Moderator Actions </h3>
<h4>2. Policy Decisions</h4>
Any objection to the content of the rules, or a policy determination made by the Directors, may be made by way of a thread posted in the News, Suggestion, and Management Discussion forum. There can be no appeal of the content of the rules or of Staff policy.
<h4>3. Staff Decisions</h4>
Any objection to the actions of a Staff member in their official capacity (such as the expression of an opinion on policy, moderation action, and so on) for any reason must be taken either by way of appeal or by way of a thread posted in the News, Suggestion, and Management Discussion forum. The Report system is not the appropriate forum to request review of these actions.
<p class="ind1">(1). If the objection is of a private or personal nature, it shall be made by way of a personal message to all of the Directors.</p>

<h4>4. Staff Posting</h4>
Any objection to the actions of a Staff member in their personal capacity (such as posting in a thread in which they are not moderating or otherwise dealing with board policy) on the basis that they have violated these rules should be taken through the standard report process. These reports are subject to the procedure set out in Title IV.

<h3> Chapter 2: Appeals Generally</h3>
<h4>5. Appealable Decisions</h4>
A user may appeal any moderator action which results in that user being awarded infraction points and/or bans, or another using being permanently banned, unless:
<p class="ind1">(1). In the opinion of the Directors, the action was necessary to protect the life, safety, privacy, or technological integrity of the board or its users; </p>
<p class="ind1">(2). In the opinion of the Directors, the conduct that led to the ban could give rise to criminal or civil legal action.</p>

<h4>6. Appeals May Be Heard Together</h4>
At the discretion of the appropriate Director, multiple appeals stemming from similar facts may be consolidated and heard together, and the decision of the Supervisor Moderator, Director, or Tribunal on those appeals will bind all of them.
<p class="ind1">(1). In any case where the appeals are to be consolidated, a defense shall be provided by a Supervisor Moderator or Director.</p>

<h4>7. Timing of Appeals</h4>
<p class="ind1">(1). All appeals must be made:</p>
<p class="ind2">(a). No earlier than twenty-four (24) hours after the infraction which is being appealed from;
<p class="ind2">(b). No later than ninety-six (96) hours after the infraction which is being appealed from.
<p class="ind1">(2). In exceptional circumstances, a Director may allow an appeal to be made up to seven days after the time limit has elapsed.</p>

<h4>8. Standard of Review</h4>
Each appeal will be determined on the standard of clear error. The Supervisor Moderator, Director, or Administrative Tribunal hearing the case will defer to the judgement of the Moderator who placed the infraction unless that decision was clearly an unreasonable interpretation of the Rules or the facts upon which the infraction is based.  

<h4>9. Correction of Plain Error</h4>
The Supervisor Moderator, Director, or Administrative Tribunal hearing the appeal shall be free to correct a plain error made by the Moderator placing the infraction (such as an inappropriate section being cited) if it appears on the face of the record to be necessary to do so.

<h4>10. Appeals Where Thread Or Post Deleted </h4>
The fact that a thread or post has been deleted as a result of, or instead of, issuing an infraction does not mean it cannot be appealed, but such appeals will be heard by the Council in a closed session, with the ultimate result and a short summary of the issues made public.

<p class="ind1">(1). If a user requires specific deleted material in order to prepare their appeal, it may be provided by a Director for that purpose.</p>

<h3> Chapter 3: Intermediate Appeals</h3>
<h4>11. Appeal to Supervisor Moderator</h4>
Any moderator action shall be appealed first to a Supervisor Moderator.

<h4>12. Procedure for Laying Appeal to Supervisor Moderator</h4>

The decision of a Supervisor Moderator shall be appealed to a Director.

<h4>14. Procedure for Laying Appeal to Director</h4>
An appeal must be made with a short statement, clearly setting out what clear error is alleged in the laying of the infraction <em>and</em> what error was committed by the Supervisor Moderator hearing the appeal.

<h4>15. Powers of Supervisor Moderator or Director on Appeal</h4>
A supervisor moderator or director hearing an appeal shall have the power to:
<p class="ind1">(1). Uphold it in its entirety;
<p class="ind1">(2). Overturn it in its entirety;
<p class="ind1">(3). Vary the infraction.

<h3>Chapter 4: Administrative Tribunal</h3>

<h4>16. Appeal to Tribunal</h4>
The decision of a Director may be appealed to the Administrative Tribunal. It shall be placed before the Tribunal by the Director whose decision is being appealed, along with the statement of the user appealing, or a statement of the defending Director or Supervisor Moderator.

A request to lay an appeal before the Tribunal by a user shall include the following:

<p class="ind1">(2). A specific statement of what is objectionable;</p>
<p class="ind1">(3). Any relevant tribunal decisions or posts which support the users's appeal.</p>

The case laid before the Tribunal by the Director shall include the following:
<p class="ind1">(1). The name of the staff member who made the decision;</p>
<p class="ind1">(2). A copy of the post or PM at issue;</p>
<p class="ind1">(3). A copy of any warning issued and the resulting action taken;</p>
<p class="ind1">(4). A copy of any relevant moderator comments on the report (if any);</p>
<p class="ind1">(5). A copy of the rule which was the basis of the moderator action.</p>

<h4>18. Restrictions on Material Before Tribunal</h4>
The Director bringing the case shall, in all cases, refrain from disclosing normally private information unless it is necessary to present the case. If it is necessary to present the case, an IP address or email address shall be redacted and/or distributed by PM to the members of the Tribunal. The staff member bringing the case shall, in all cases of specific content which is in dispute as objectionable place it within a spoiler tag, clearly marked, unless it is disputably illegal, in which case it shall be redacted and a short summary shall be presented in its place.

<h4>19. Powers of Tribunal Hearing Appeal</h4>
The Tribunal hearing the Appeal shall have the power to:
<p class="ind1">(1). Uphold it in its entirety.</p>
<p class="ind1">(2). Overturn it in its entirety.</p>
