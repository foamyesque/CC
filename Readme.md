<h1>Community Compact</h1>



<h2>Our Purpose</h2>
Sufficient Velocity is aimed at providing an open and inclusive place for all our users, with a transparent and even-handed administration, and a focus on discussing science fiction and fantasy creative works and roleplaying.



<h2>Rules</h2>

  In brief: Don't break the law, don't post porn, don't post gore, don't spam, and don't harass people.
  
  Anywhere these rules refer to a person, that rule applies equally to real, fictional, and legal persons.
  
  <h3>1. Illegal Material</h3>

You agree not to post anything that is against the law of the United States, Australia, or Canada. Things that may fall under this section include, but are not limited to:

  (1). Child pornography, including simulated and written child pornography
  (2). Threats against another user or specific person.
  (3). Slander and libel, i.e., specific untrue factual allegations about any person.
  (4). Hate speech, i.e., advocating genocide or incitement of hatred against any identifiable group.
  (5). Harassment, i.e., stalking, doxxing, etc.
  (6). Copyright infringement, including links to things that are infringements of copyright, such as scans of manga, game torrents, and so on.
  (7). Obscene material 


<h3>2. Unacceptable Content</h3>

  You agree not to post anything that is intended to appeal to the prurient interest, including, but not limited to, anything that:
    (1). Depicts, appears to depict, or describes children unclothed or in a sexual fashion;
    (2). Expresses sexual intention or desire or imputes a sexual act or any sexual connotation toward minors;
    (3). Depicts or explicitly describes adults engaged in sexual acts or otherwise fully naked;
    (4). Depicts or explicitly describes anyone, or any animal, in a state of extreme injury or physical trauma;
    (5). Expresses advocacy, promotion, or other comment that suggests that any person should be, or deserves to be, the victim of any violent, degrading, or sexual act. 

  You agree that you will place below a labelled spoiler anything which:
    (6). Contains prominent sexual imagery;
    (7). Contains visible violence, injury, or trauma, even if fictional;
    (8). Might shock the conscience

  This does not prohibit the discussion of news or historical events, educational or academic material, or literary or artistic works so long as such discussion is tasteful and contains as little description as is reasonably necessary. It also does not prohibit the posting of content if that content has been explicitly approved, in writing, by the Staff as having enough merit to warrant an exception to this rule.

  
<h3>3. Hate Speech</h3>

  You agree not to post anything that constitutes hate speech, including, but not limited to:
    (1). The promotion or advocacy of extermination, torture, maiming, or other violent acts directed against a group of people, by race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, nationality, or otherwise;
    (2). The promotion or advocacy of harassment or violence against any specific individual person for any reason;
    (3). The hateful or pejorative use of slurs or other language, whether based on race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, or otherwise; 


<h3>4. Harrassment</h3>

  You agree you will not do anything considered to be harassment, including, but not limited to:
    (1). Using the conversation system to send unwanted private messages to another user;
    (2). Posting personal attacks which go beyond the level of what might reasonably be expressed in frustration in the course of a debate;
    (3). Participating in a discussion solely for the purpose of attacking another user;
    (4). Making public private or personal information without the approval everyone concerned, such as names and addresses, photos, or material posted with an expectation of privacy (such as conversations or restricted-access forums)
    (5). Posting that you have another user on ignore;
    (6). Threatening to report another user;


<h3>5. Disruptive Behaviour</h3>

You agree you will not do anything considered to be disruptive, including, but not limited to:
  (1). Making a significant number of threads in quick succession;
  (2). Making multiple unnecessary sequential posts;
  (3). Overuse of single-image posts or memes;
  (4). Piling on another user with additional vitriol, complaints, praise, etc.
  (5). Posting spoilers where they are inappropriate;
  (6). Debating in bad faith;
  (7). Participating in a discussion with the intent or effect of disrupting it, such as by posting off-topic material;
  (8). Challenging Staff decisions in the location where they were made;
  (9). Encouraging any other person to do anything against this Compact
  
<h3>6. Abuse of Site Resources</h3>
  
  You agree you will not misuse site resources, including, but not limited to:
    (1). Using the resources of the site to harass any person or organization, such as by counselling or advocating disruptive action on another site or launching campaigns against them;
    (2). Using the site for financial gain or advertising without staff permission;
    (3). Making frivolous reports

<h3>7. Linking</h3>
  
  You agree that you will not post a link or any other direction to any webpage or other content that would, if posted on this site, violate its rules. This applies to all elements of a webpage, including any advertising appearing on it.



<h2>Appeals and Pre-Approval of Content</h2>

  As part of our commitment to a fair and open administration, Sufficient Velocity has a system that allows users to appeal and discuss Staff decisions. We also have a system for users to check whether their content is acceptable prior to posting it.


<h3>1. Formal Appeals</h3>
  
  In most cases, if you have received an infraction, you may appeal it by posting a new thread in the Appeals forum. Threads in the Appeals forum are visible only to the Staff and to the user that created it. 
  
  Decisions made about potentially illegal material may not be appealed. 
  
  We request appeals be made promptly, within four days of the infraction. Exceptions may be made at the discretion of the Staff.
  
  In an appeal, we ask that you provide the following information:
    (1). A link to the material you received an infraction for;
    (2). A quote of any messages from the Staff concerning the infraction;
    (3). An explanation of why you feel the infraction could not be justified under these rules.
    
  
  An appeal will usually proceed through up to three stages:
    (1). It is first considered by a Supervisor Moderator;
    (2). If the decision made by the Supervisor Moderator is unsatisfactory, you may request that it be reviewed by the Directors;
    (3). If the decision made by the Directors is unsatisfactory, you may request that it be reviewed by a Tribunal of the Community Council
    
  In some cases, at the discretion of the Directors, an appeal may be either be heard immediately by the Directors or proceed directly to a Tribunal of the Community Council.   
    
  Both the Supervisor Moderators and the Directors have the right to alter the original Staff action in any way they deem fit, including but not limited to:
      (1). Complete removal;
      (2). Correcting the basis of the Staff action;
      (3). Altering the severity of the Staff action, in either direction;
      (4). Performing additional Staff actions
      
      
<h3>2. Administrative Tribunals</h3>
  
  A Tribunal is the final stage of the appeals process. Unlike review by a Supervisor Moderator or Director, it is conducted in public, with a decision being made by Community Council. 
  
  These decisions are binding on the Staff and offer guidance to the Staff in their interpretation and administration of these rules.
  
  If an appeal to the Tribunal is granted, we ask that you provide the following:
    (1). A short summary (no longer than 1,000 words) of your appeal;
    (2). An explanation of why you feel the infraction could not be justified under these rules.
    (3). Any tribunal decisions or posts which support your appeal.
    
  A Tribunal case will be presented by a Director. In addition to your statement, the Director will provide the following for the Tribunal to consider:
    (1). The name of the staff member who made the decision;
    (2). A copy of the post or PM at issue;
    (3). A copy of any warning issued and the resulting action taken;
    (4). A copy of any relevant moderator comments on the report (if any);
    (5). A copy of the rule which was the basis of the moderator action.
  
  Any private information necessary to present the case will be disclosed only to the Community Councillors, and to the minimum extent necessary for their duties. 
  
  An Administrative Tribunal's binding decision may only judge a Staff action either valid in full or invalid in full. It cannot selectively overturn or modify them.

<h3>3. Discussion of Staff Actions</h3>
  
  Challenging or discussing Staff actions where they occur is prohibited as disruptive. However, banning all such discussion is not in line with Sufficient Velocity's ideals. 
  
  Instead, if you want to talk about some particular staff action or policy without undertaking a formal appeal, you may:
  (1). Start a conversation with a Staff member;
  (2). Start a thread in the News and Management subforum


<h3>4. Pre-Approval of Content</h3>

  You may request the Staff review material for you prior to posting it. To do so:
    (1). Post the material in the Appeals forum;
    (2). Include an explanation of the context of the material;
    (3). Include a link to the location you intend to post it
    
  Material that goes through this process may still be deleted if circumstances warrant, but infractions will not be issued for it.



<h2>Staff and Community Council</h2>

  There are several different kinds of Staff on Sufficient Velocity, as well as a user-elected Community Council, each with different roles and responsibilities. 
  
  
<h3>1. Directors</h3>

  The Directors are, broadly speaking, the ones in charge of Sufficient Velocity. They oversee the maintenance, operation, and policy of the forum, and judge appeals of both Supervisor Moderator decisions and others at their discretion.


<h3>2. Supervisor Moderators</h3>

  Supervisor Moderators provide policy guidance and judge appeals from the decisions of the Moderators. They typically do not perform the same tasks as Moderators, but may do so if need arises.


<h3>3. Moderators</h3>

  Moderators enforce these rules and perform housekeeping tasks, such as moving or renaming threads or merging posts.

<h3>4. Staff Appointment and Removal</h3>

  Supervisor Moderators and Moderators are appointed by the Directors on a consensus basis. They must first serve a probationary period of eight weeks under the supervision of the Directors. After a satisfactory completion of the probationary period, they may be confirmed by the Directors to their position for an indefinite term.
  
  Supervisor Moderators and Moderators may be removed for cause and for non-performance. 
    (1). Any Moderator or Supervisor Moderator who has been idle in the performance of their duties without approval for more than 60 days may be removed by a simple majority vote of the Directors.
    (2). Any Moderator or Supervisor Moderator may be removed for cause by the presentation of an appropriate case to the Tribunal.
    
  Supervisor Moderators and Moderators may resign at any time by a statement to that effect.


<h3>5. Community Council</h3>

  The Community Council is a group of twelve non-Staff users, elected by the Sufficient Velocity community to act as representatives. They judge Tribunals and are consulted on some matters of policy.
  
  Election to the Community Council is a two-stage process:
    (1). Nomination phase: Any user in good standing may nominate any two other users in good standing. The twenty-four users with the most nominations will move on to the ballot stage. In the event of a tie, the first to be nominated wins.
    (2). Users will vote on the twenty-four top candidates from the nomination phase. Users may vote for as many of the twenty-four candidates as they wish. The top twelve will become Community Councillors. In the event of a tie, a giant green space monster will eat you.
    
  Elections are held once a year, for one year terms, every August. The nomination phase will run from August 6 to August 13, and the voting phase from August 16 to August 23. 
  
  Councillors may not serve more than two consecutive terms. 
  
  Councillors may be removed for cause and for non-performance. 
    (1). Any Councillor who has been idle in the performance of their duties without approval for three consecutive Tribunals may be removed by a simple majority vote of the Directors.
    (2). Any Councillor may be removed for cause by the Community Council, after presentation of an appropriate case in a Tribunal.
    
  Councillors may resign at any time by a statement to that effect.
  
  If more than one Council position is open, a special election will be held for all open positions. If the election occurs more than half-way through the regular Council term, the Councillors elected in it will not be considered to have served a term.


<h3>6. Code of Conduct</h3>
  
  Both Staff members and Community Councillors are expected to engage in their duties in an impartial and professional manner. In particular, in addition to being expected to follow the rules in the Compact like any other user, they are expected to:
  
  (1). Not moderate or judge discussions they are involved in unless urgently required;
  (2). Not use any privileges extended to them to harass or suppress legitimate discussion;
  (3). Respect user confidentiality and privacy at all times
